## Getting started

Download the modpack on the Twitch Launcher. When downloaded, go to profile options and uncheck "Locked" (see images).

![Access Profile Options](../images/modpack_settings/access_profile_options.png)
![Unlock Profile](../images/modpack_settings/unlock_profile.png)

This will allow you to add the additional mods that we are going to use.

## Swaping configs

You should also use the new configs, so that your client is synced with the ones on the server. You can download it [here](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Amq7FpDvPImOsxRFCekooYPNbBdr).

## Troubleshooting

If you try to connect to the server and it tells you that you have the wrong version of a mod, simply click that mod in the modlist, press "Versions" and download the right version instead.
